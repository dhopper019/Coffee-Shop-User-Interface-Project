# Coffee-Shop-User-Interface-Project
The programming project I did in a team of 4 people during college.
Please use the Eclipse IDE which is open source and can be accessed here: https://www.eclipse.org/
Please follow the Apache Derby Setup Instructions to set the database up on Eclipse.
Finally, run the application with Manager.java as the main file.
